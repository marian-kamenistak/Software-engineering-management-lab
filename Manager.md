A title makes you a manager, your people make you a leader. The top priority of any manager is the well-being and success of their people. Find the best ideas, not consensus. Define first principles. Compensation demonstrates love and respect. Innovation is where the crazy people have stature. Build an envelope of trust. Be relentlessly honest and candid. Offer stories not order. Be an evangelist for courage. Let them bring their full identity. Team comes first. Work the team, then the problem. Pick the right players. Pair great people. Diversity wins. See and solve the elephant in the room. Stop the bitch sessions. Win, but with commitment, integrity and teamwork. Lead. Fill gaps between people. Love! Love! Love! To care about people you have to care about people. Cheer for success. Build community. Help people. Love the founders. Build relationships.

ENG + GSD: as infrastructure + product teams. No knowledge, but opportunity to travel. Mixed mode.
ENG metrics
GSD metrics
with groovy, GSD move, GSD shake.
in the pool, evaluate/rate the peoples` knowledge on: technologies, products. Do ask for self-review + DO the test.
GSD people can work in ENG items, as they know the best what the customer needs. No need to wait for ENG to resolve the task.
ENG people should experience at least 1 client facing project to feel the power, the driving factor of the company, which is not to be hidden behind the scenes or the monitor.

Product development flow: make simple first. Afterwards, spend time on useful features only customers Really demand, if you succeed find cutomers for the product. Don`t burn the time on products and features nobody needs really.
Products killed fast when no customer is found.

consider to: spend 6m to innovate: i`ve experienced the 3y the freeze. Lower start then, but sky rocketing high compare to competitors.
consider to how to achieve the 3x3
re-evaluate product priorities: for me: freeze, do groovy and new UI. Compromize: freze projects having no alpha-customer. There is half of them, see (me) the product list and review.


speak with Mark and Bruno, presentation, video as the strong message

Groovy demo on pricing syntax and features, as buy-in

# Social Media Presence > company/leader tech blog
Demonstrating restraint, kindness, professionalism and moderation online never used to be a leadership requirement, but I believe it may be one of our most important to set an example at work, at home, and to others who watch what we say and do. Now more than ever, the lines are blurred between our social and professional selves.   - John O'Connor, Career Pro Inc.

# Authenticity
Leaders used to be able to keep a distance from the masses. Today, confidence and belief in leadership is directly correlated to engagement, productivity and retention. Authenticity is about *connecting to all levels of your team, personally and professionally*. Access to leadership has been a trend in organizations. Leaders now need to let people see the person behind the curtain, not just the position.   - Michelle Tillis Lederman, Executive Essentials


# Manage Your Team for the Long and Short Game
I once worked for a manager prone to distraction because he was eager to please his managers and show off to his office crush. To display his industriousness, he responded to incoming work requests by pulling the whole team off ongoing work, despite looming deadlines. If he used a project schedule, he would have realized the team was almost evenly spread between longer term projects and short-term work.
Instead of always defaulting to all hands on deck, this manager could have pulled a team member or two from a project where the new priority wouldn’t compromise the whole team’s deadlines. Managing the short and the long game means effectively prioritizing work on longer ongoing projects, as well as the shorter projects that will occur as well.

# How balanced is my engineering resource pie?
If you’re like us, you probably allocate priorities according to a pie model—say, 50% of your resources go to new features, 25% to bugs, and 25% to infrastructure and R&D. When strategizing a new set of priorities, make sure you’ve balanced your breakdown. Of course, you’ll never divide priorities exactly according to your pie each quarter. Which is why product managers must also ask themselves to assess imbalances in their previous pie—and aim for an even allocation over the year.

# Executution:
- https://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Achieving-Wildly-Important/dp/1491517751


# Effective manager:
1. Eliminate: Does this task need to be done? Does it help me get to where I want to go?
    If yes, go to Delegate.
    If no — don’t do it!
2. Delegate: Can this task be delegated?
    If yes, delegate.
    If no, see if you can automate it, then delegate it.
3. Automate: Can this task be automated?
    If yes, automate.
    If no, execution time.

#    Work in the same boat
Majority of US workers feel socially detached
Human connection & believing in mission = Increase in promotions & engagement
The opposite (isolation) breeds the opposite (demoralization, loss in performance)
Connect with others by giving them your undivided attention (a rare gift these days)

Put on your own oxygen mask first. Assess your own connectedness
Foster an open/transparent environment (for both work and personal info)
Say thanks (gratitude increases feeling of efficacy/self-worth in others)
Highlight other people’s good work
Randomly do something nice (benefits both giver and recipient)

#    The key to managing people - listen, recognize their abilities, & help them grow
The biggest motivator is making progress on meaningful work
So a manager’s first job is to facilitate the team’s progress by providing support, tools, resources, and feedback
“First, do no harm” - hire talented people and get out of the way (and get obstacles out of their way)
Ask people about their goals/motivations (personal and professional)
Use Heart/Tree/Star
- HEART: What do you love doing? What are you good at?
- TREE: What do want to develop? How do you want to grow? Where do you want to end up in the future?
- STAR: How do you feel rewarded?
See boss blueprint (mine is on the wiki)
With personal knowledge about each individual, find the “sweet spot” of just enough challenge/stretch to motivate but not overwhelm
Consider personal development horizontally (not everyone wants to climb corp ladder)
People leave their jobs not to leave the company, but to leave their manager


Your job is to enable, support, and resolve. It’s 50/50 direct mediation and guidance: http://blog.capwatkins.com/my-role-as-a-manager
Customize everyone’s job to their skills/interests/values; improves enjoyment/effectiveness
Provide growth/promotion paths for folks who want to remain ICs: http://moz.com/rand/if-management-is-the-only-way-up-were-all-fd/
Communicate repeatedly what the team’s purpose is and why
Take responsibility for the state of the team. Ask “how might I make this better?”
Foster your people’s visibility. Make their resumes look great. http://annfriedman.com/post/85021148718/on-being-a-boss
Be honest about your strengths/weaknesses so you can grow
Hire based on relationships/ensemble, not rockstars

# how to update the boss
Every Friday afternoon, I’d send my boss a short email with three categories:
- The work I had completed that week
- What I was working on, including any deadlines that may have shifted or obstacles I’d encountered
- What I was waiting on—that is, tasks that I’d completed, but require sign-off from my boss or contributions from someone else
Over the years, I refined the practice. I used a timer to ensure that the weekly update would not take longer than 15 minutes to write. I used a simple template where I could pop in information, so as to expedite the process.
## Manage Your Own Success (it’s not luck or random)
Assess the disconnect. Gap between perception & reality in your performance?
“Do things. Tell people” Success doesn’t speak for itself. Hype yourself. Follow-up
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen (or done)
Send regular status updates to your boss in her language, at whatever frequency/style she will understand






# to make changes:
- go bottom-up, get the key players on your side
- To make interventions into the organization structure and change its vision rarely works if the responsible decision-maker does not have the social reputation, respect and ability to win the key players for the plan. To get down to radical changes without a natural authority is almost impossible.

 Ako dobry manager, ak chcme uspiet, musim tie myslienky a zmeny nainfikovat zospoda is bottom-up.
 Inak to bude moj pad. Ludia su chytri, nechaj nech sa v myslienke najdu. Investuj do nich cas. To je na blog.

ideas:
- posielat report co robime ceaz teamy zdola hore, ako pribeh a nie len tabulku, nech to ludia radi citaju. Pochvalit ludi, ukazat progress.
- as GSD, close the loop: 4 items
- see Amazon whitepapers
- see the company`s turnover, ask per product and about the revenue
- squads: team org: PM, PO, Scrum Master role
- see my proposal to Ravi
- tech debt + why to tackle it
- squads vs functional structure: propose both
- apm, structure101
- internal and external blog: transparency, awareness, hiring
- what are the SLAs?

study: Tool chain, cross compiler, embedded container, ai, deep learning, biometrics, oracle + postgres optimizer
testing: consider Arquillian

to succeed: pocitaj si kolko od kazdeho chces a kolko davas, tieto veliciny musia byt v balancu. To mi zaruci miesto.
Ales:
- management ideas: always keep balance: nielen obmedzovat (testy, sonar), ale aj davat (zjednodusovat: CI, CD)

# metrics:
- The metrics that are elevated — from daily active users to revenue growth — effectively compare companies, but don’t necessarily help them run better. In fact, these measurements often slant toward what investors want to measure, showing if a company is valuable, not how it can create more value.
