# Influencing others
Influence is the power to affect someone/something w/o directly forcing them. It’s about establishing credibility, finding common ground, and connecting emotionally. This requires active listening and effective questioning

It’s not about a hard sell, a one-time effort, argument. Manipulation is selfish and devious. Coercion is forced and includes threats.
## Active Listening
Active listening means listening to understand. Active listening skills:
paraphrase what the other person said and/or take notes
give nonverbal cues that you’re listening (e.g. make eye-contact, stop doing other things)
silence voice in your head that’s providing commentary or teeing up what to say next
not interrupting, unless it’s to...
ask followup questions, which brings us to…
## Effective Questioning
Know when to ask open-ended vs yes/no questions
Open ended-questions are used to understand what’s important to the other person, e.g.
-Why do you think we shouldn’t include that step?
-Tell me what matters most to you about this decision
-What reservations do you have about going in this direction?
Yes/no questions gauge commitment to a specific approach:
-Can you see how taking this step will solve this problem?
-Will you support me with this?

# Systematic Approach to Influencing
Capture the idea, alternative, or opportunity that requires your influence
Identify stakeholders
For each stakeholder
-Identify your reasons for needing to influence him/her
-Gauge their commitment (committed, neutral/unsure, resistant)
-Tailor a strategy to increase their commitment, connecting emotionally and logically (see below)
-Execute strategy
-Ask questions to reassess commitment
-Agree on next steps

# Influence Strategies
Focus on benefits (connect emotionally): tie the benefits to organizational goals
Build a case (emotionally or analytically): be up front, ask how you can build a case they’ll like
Tie it to org goals/values
Tap into network: before large meeting, pre-meet to gain buy-in or just ask their opinion
Give stakeholders a taste of the current pain or the proposed solution
Plan small wins

Different strategies may work better/worse depending on the other person’s personality
Dominant seeks opptys for change and makes things happen → Give a taste
Influence relies on gut and openly discloses feelings → Focus on benefits
Steady/Conscientious explores all possibilities and relies on logic → build case w/ small wins
