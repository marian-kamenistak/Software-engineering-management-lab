# Delegation
1. Am I the right person to handle this Situation? No?, who is the right Situation handler? Have I triangulated the facts? discovered multiple different perspectives? What has happened to the facts as I’ve looked at them through different lenses? What has this triangulation told me about my sources of information?
2. Do I have complete context? all the essential facts, opinions, and lies? Have all relevant, affected, and interested parties who care about the Situation weighed in?
3. What is the track record of my sources of information? Do I trust the sources of information? If I have a track record with these humans, how does that color the information they provided? Do I understand the nature of the biases of those providing the information? Am I clear what they have to lose or gain by sharing this information?
4.  Do they volunteer these losses or gains as part of my discovery?
5. What inconsistencies in facts have been discovered and do I understand the nature of those inconsistencies? I’m not looking for resolution for inconsistencies, just the nature. He and she disagree on principle. He didn’t have all the essential facts so it kind’a looks like he’s lying.
6. Do I understand my biases relative to the Situation? If my role in this Situation is to make a decision, part of understanding involves understanding my bias. With this understanding of bias in hand, am I still the right person to make an informed call here?
7. Do I understand my emotional state relative to the issue at hand? A sure-fire way to bias my judgment is emotion. Like bias, it is nigh impossible to separate my emotions from an issue, whether those emotions are positive, negative, or a bit of both. Am I clear how emotion is affecting me relative to this decision? If it’s affecting me negatively, will cool-down time help? No, ok, who is a better neutral party who can make a decision here?
8. Can I coherently explain multiple perspectives of the Situation? What happens when I explain one perspective of the Situation to a neutral party? How about when I explain the competing perspective? If I can effectively explain the Situation and its complexity from both perspectives and with a distinct lack of emotion, I’m close.


# Delegation Checklist
Share these steps with the person, ask him/her to come back with a plan (esp for #9), cocreate where appropriate. Establish what decisions each person owns.

Identify a project that you'd like to delegate to one of your employees. Something that will be a stretch, but not beyond his or her capability.
Why is the project important for the organization? For the employee?
How will success be measured?
Are there any pitfalls to be avoided?
What's the deadline?
Are there milestones when you want your direct report to discuss progress with you?
Are there any stakeholders who need to be consulted along the way?
Are there any additional resources that might be helpful?
What kind of support or direction do you anticipate your direct report will need along the way? How can you solicit that when you hand off the project?
