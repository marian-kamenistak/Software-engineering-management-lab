I'm passionate about building products by enabling the talent around me.
I have a mathematician mindset; I started coding at age 11. I moved from a dev role to a team lead to a principal architect. I naturally moved to management to gain a more significant impact through leadership. I've mentored 60+ engineering leaders across the globe.
My principles: Transparency. Fairness. Consistency. Lead by example, walking the walk. Kaizen.
