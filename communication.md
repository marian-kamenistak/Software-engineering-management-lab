# hints
  - mantra: HELP THEM GROW
  - be useful, help.
  - basic rule is to help as many times as they help you in return
  - ask for the feedback: kick me in the balls
  - in form of Questions: 50-50 mix of statements to questions. Striving for that ratio is also good way to test whether you’ve gone off track: If you’re only making statements, you’re not having a conversation.
  - nevymyslaj intrigy, neklam. Ludia to poznaju, najma ti dobri, dobrych nechces stratit.

# deliver feedback:

Build regular, low-key feedback into the team’s work practice
Without that, just saying “I’d like to offer feedback” is pretty loaded — people feel like they must have done something bad to merit unsolicited feedback. Then you’re fighting to be heard.

If there’s a regular habit of checking in, of saying “What did I/we/you do well, what could we do better?”, then people will hear your feedback not as external judgement, but as something they can and want to learn from.

Start off by asking them “How do you think it went? What do you think was good, what could we improve?” Demonstrates respect, and encourages them to start asking those questions themselves
Ask first.  “Would you like to hear a suggestion?” or “Do you mind if I give you feedback?”.  Psychologically prepares them for criticism.
Use the “Oreo” approach.  The feedback is still direct (should have had performance testing) but there is also focus on things that went well. Counterpoint: this is also called the “shit sandwich”
Be timely.  Provide it in the moment when the person can still correct their actions.
Make it about the task, not the person.
Give suggestions on how to improve. Don’t bring up problems without solutions. Give actionable examples and ideas on how to make something better.
Provide a personal example.  “I learned this the hard way” Make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making that mistake.
Identify the motive or reason for the changes.  Provide people the “why” behind your suggestions, makes it that much more effective.
Allow the person to defend/vent/explain.  Listen and allow them to say their piece. You want people to feel good after talking to you!
Invite their feedback on you. People are more likely to feel like the team as a whole is trying to improve itself, and less like wisdom is a one-way street from manager to reports

## critical feedback

When Giving Negative Feedback, Stick to the Facts:
Everyone needs feedback to grow. But if you deliver it in a way that feels like an attack, your employees will probably get defensive and shut down. Here’s how to give negative feedback more productively:
Start the conversation by noting when and where the behavior you want to discuss occurred. Next, describe it in detail, explaining exactly what you saw and heard. For example: “In our staff meeting this morning, when we were discussing strategies, you interrupted Jessica while she was talking and said, ‘That idea will never work.’”
Describe your reaction to the behavior. You might say: “Your interruption disappointed me because I didn’t get to hear more from Jessica, and it also made me not want to share my own ideas.”
When done well, this fact-based approach is not judgmental and doesn’t try to analyze the person’s motives. As a result, the employee is less likely to get defensive, which means they’re more likely to thoughtfully consider what you’re saying.

## Feedback for high performers:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OykzZJ59ERO0ePwRSzs6uRpjtYTOhi1PgRG9J6AAzzM/edit#
TLDR
Do:
- Give both positive and constructive feedback to high performers regularly
- Identify development areas, even if there are only a few
- Focus on the future, and ask about motivations and goals
Don’t:
- Presume a star has reached the limits of her performance
- Leave your top performers alone
- Assume your stars know how appreciated they are

It’s harder to give feedback to those that are doing the best, but don’t phone it in
- Do homework to gather data and details that support your feedback
- Always describe behaviors, not traits
- Don't dwell on the past; focus on what can change in the future
- Check your understanding & clarify and agree on next steps
- Find fair, specific ways to measure progress
Don’t assume your star is perfect
- Everyone has room for improvement
- You do your star a disservice if you fail to help her figure out how she can grow
- Results aren't the only thing that's important - how someone achieves their results and at what cost are important
Regularly discuss these three topics in ongoing feedback sessions:
Current Performance
- Express gratitude for current performance
- Don't assume that top performers already know how well they're doing
- Be specific. Call out Specific Behavior → Impact of that Behavior
- Constructive feedback is more easily received if it's preceded by genuine appreciation for hard work (but avoid “shit sandwich”)
Next Performance Frontier
- Your top performer became so good b/c they’re committed to self improvement. It’s your responsibility to help her to keep improving
- Acknowledge what might be blocking the next level
- Discuss what can be done to overcome those obstacles
Identify Future Goals and Aspirations
- Understand motivations and values. Example questions:
- What do you want to be known for?
- What matters most to you?
- Provide a chance to reflect on career path, and how current role → next performance frontier, fit together
- Figure out how to align her motivations with those of the company.
- Some people will always perform well, but others do their best when their own excellence is aligned with that of the organization.
- Partner together on your own success as a manager:
- "How can I continue to support your high performance?"
- "What can we do as an organization to keep getting better and supporting your great work?"
Frequency is key - don't leave high-performers alone or wait for review time. Your company relies upon top performers, so invest time to support and develop them.


# how to GET MORE feedback from your team
- https://getlighthouse.com/blog/get-more-feedback-team
## Ask for specific feedback, e.g. “Would you like more or less direction from me on your work?”, not “Do you have any feedback for me?”. More specific questions:
How could we change our team meetings to be more effective?
What could I do to make you enjoy your work more?
Do you feel your ideas are heard by the team and me?
What part of the day do you have the most energy and focus? What changes could we make to accommodate this?
## Be grateful and accepting of feedback. Assume positive intent.
First thank them for the feedback
Ask them to share a recent situation where the feedback applies
Ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand the core of their feedback.
Talk about possible solutions/changes, or explain the context they need to know.
## Take action, which will validate their courage to give you feedback. Or emancipate them to take action. When you can’t change something, helping them understand why it is that way can help them empathize and better tolerate things.
## Lead by example and reciprocate: give great feedback and praise to others.
Hold blameless postmortems
Own up to your own mistakes


# how to give compliment:
A compliment is a “selfless, well articulated, and timely recognition of achievement.”
selfless: Comes without perceived social cost or dependency. Contains nothing about you or what you want. Entirely about the achievement of the other
well articulated: document the act, the value, and the impact. That detail will make it memorable
timely: the faster you compliment, the more they’re going to remember – not your compliment – but the act
recognition: understand what behavior you want to recognize and why, and based on that decide what mode/format/time to give the compliment
achievement: large or small, highlight when the team or its members are at their best

- Power Up Your Team with Nonviolent Communication Principles | First Round Review | http://firstround.com/review/power-up-your-team-with-nonviolent-communication-principles/
When you lead from a place of fear, you ask closed questions and get closed answers
NVC allows us to speak in terms of what we observe, how we’re feeling, what our needs are, and how we respond to others’ requests.
Four ingredients...

Observation: say what you see, but not what you think of it. “What I’m hearing you ask me is…” or “I see that you want this…”
Emotional Audit: check in with your body and identify adjectives that describe the sensations you’re feeling. “I’m feeling tired because…” “When this happens, it makes me feel like…”
Needs: list the needs that are connected to the feelings you’ve identified. “Because I value my happiness, I need…”
Requests: needs are the missing pieces. Requests are what you use to get them. “I am wondering if…” “Would you be willing to?”

A-E-I-O-U Model of Managing Conflict:
Acknowledge the positive intentions: Assume the other person in the argument means well. Try to understanding his or her rationale and state it out loud directly to them
Express what you see: use statements that make it clear that your words are your own: “I think/I feel.”
Identify a solution: define your objectives and recommendations. What’s the outcome you want to achieve? Build consensus by demonstrating how your solution will resolve everyone’s concerns, not just your own.
Outline the Outcome: What’s in it for your opposition if they agree to accommodate you? Recognition (“Thanks, I appreciate your flexibility on this issue”) can go a long way toward establishing harmony.
Understanding: ask for feedback. Nail down agreement on a next action or step, or work together to develop alternatives. Give the other person the option to accept your proposal without admitting defeat.

### Five (dys)functions of a team
- Part 2: Overcome the 5 Dysfunctions of a Team – The Mission – Medium | https://medium.com/the-mission/part-2-overcome-the-5-dysfunctions-of-a-team-ef922309f8b5
These five functions (each building on the previous) need to be in place to have a healthy team culture:
Trust (psych. safety): members need to be vulnerable w/ each other and admit mistakes. Teams that trust one another...
Unafraid of conflict: ...are not afraid to engage in passionate dialog to find the best answers. They give each other permission to disagree. Teams that engage in unfiltered conflict…
Commitment: ...are able to reach buy-in around important decisions. They use a responsibility framework (like RACI) so decision-making is clear. Teams that commit to decisions and standards…
Accountability: ...hold one another accountable for adhering to decisions and standards. Teams that trust one another, engage in healthy conflict, commit to decisions, and hold one another accountable…
Attention to results: ...are likely to set aside individual needs to focus on collective results that define team success.


### Resolving Conflict
Ask yourself these questions
What role might I be playing in this situation? How am I contributing to the problem?
Why would a rational/reasonable person do what they did? (Assume good intent)
What do you want for this relationship? What would you do if you wanted that?

Be confident with facts
But be tentative with interpretation
Then encourage the other person to poke holes in your interpretation:

“In this morning’s meeting, I heard you say…” [fact] “It made me wonder if maybe…” [interpretation] “Is that what you meant, or did you mean something else?” [encourage]
### Mediation
Dysfunction and conflict are prevented and addressed with a 3-step system:
Norms in charter → Coaching on independent problem-solving → Mediation

Define the business problem in this conflict (only mediate if it’s business-related)
Hear each individual separately but avoid being go-between
Before, get commitment to stay engaged (ask for 4hrs)
During, if person quits, say “you committed, is this the best you can do?”
Arrange the table/seating for dialogue
Focus the participants on talking to each other
Don’t stop if it gets emotional. Do stop if it could get physical.
Draft a balanced agreement to solve the problem (same # of actions for each participant)
Troubleshoot the agreement 1 and 2 weeks later
