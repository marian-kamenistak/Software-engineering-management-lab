# Rules to Define the Goals
Gather expectations
Note that the proposed list of goals has to reflect the expectations of all individual teams/team leads as well as those defined by upper management
come up with personal goals
Propose and formalize the goals
aligned with the values and vision
Support and push the ideas of the colleagues for the 1st year, as they know the best what are the issues/challenges.
balance
the short/mid/long-term goals, make sure we are consistent in the long-term vision, don`t scale for 1y only.
top management and the teams and personal goals
keep the balance from the top, bottom and personal (at least 1 personal)
spread across the different scopes: organizational, processes, technical
define the goals being SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and resource-based, Time-based; + define the Dependencies and consider whether they are/will be available
order by priorities. Pick up the ones with shortest time and highest influence/value (20% → 80% rule)
balance:
1 for the product/project (individual) - MUST HAVE
1 for the team (team`s cohesion) - MUST HAVE
1 personal
Agree on the goals
Consequently, define the path of How to achieve the goals (roadmap)

> Goals : nie len co sme zlepšili ale aj čomu sme predišli : people leadership, continuity, issues resolved

# Goal setting
How to set team goals
From a conversation with my colleague David Wolpa
## Deciding on a goal
Why do people choose to join your org/team?
What goals has the team really rallied around in the past? Why?
Look at "paired metrics" from High Output Management, e.g. output + quality
measuring outcomes ($, billable hours), not inputs (utilization, "time spent on tickets")
People should have role in determining the goal
Also in setting the target (which should be stretch but realistic)
To what degree is achieving the goal directly under team's control?
## Communicating a goal
Explain why goal is important to business, esp. when there's a disconnect from day-to-day
Need to do that repeatedly throughout the goal-measurement period
Naming/ritual gets people bought into it (e.g. fundraising thermometer)

Then, categorize the responses in one of three ways:
50% vanish
25% do the assignment
25% make shit happen well beyond what the assignment was. These are the leaders


# How to Put the Right Amount of Pressure on Your Team | https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-put-the-right-amount-of-pressure-on-your-team
There’s an ideal level of stress
Assess the current state, and identify people who are burdened by too much stress
You’ll know whether you need to dial the heat up, or bring it back down to a simmer
## To add more stress:
Increase the frequency and pointedness of coaching
Connect the person’s behavior to something bigger and more important
Allow a natural negative consequence for a lack of action
## To remove stress:
Provide frequent positive feedback - recognize/reinforce small victories and help problem-solve
Break the problem into smaller pieces - divide the project among a group of people and/or into sequential steps
Add structure to the problem - help your team think about how to tackle it
Model confidence - show ppl with your words and body language that you believe everything will work out
