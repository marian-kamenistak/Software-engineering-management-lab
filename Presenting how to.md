Tips for Giving a Persuasive Presentation
When you need to sell an idea at work or in a presentation, how do you do it? Five rhetorical devices can help — Aristotle identified them 2,000 years ago, and masters of persuasion still use them today:

Ethos. Start your talk by establishing your credibility and character. Show your audience that you are committed to the welfare of others, and you will gain their trust.
Logos. Use data, evidence, and facts to support your pitch.
Pathos. People are moved to action by how a speaker makes them feel. Wrap your big idea in a story that will elicit an emotional reaction.
Metaphor. Compare your idea to something that is familiar to your audience. It will help you clarify your argument by making the abstract concrete.
Brevity. Explain your idea in as few words as possible. People have a limited attention span, so talk about your strongest points first.


interactivity: add slido or any from to get feedback or make public decisions

# Losing Your Audience During a Presentation? Try This
You can tell when an audience has stopped listening to a presentation. Phones come out, people slouch in their seats, maybe someone dozes off. If you notice this happening during your talk, try a few techniques to grab people’s attention.
Move around the room. It keeps audience members guessing where you’ll go next, which means their eyes are trained on you.
Lower your voice, or even pause. Speaking in a monotone isn’t very engaging, of course, and neither is always speaking at the same volume. To regain attention, try speaking softly so that people need to focus in order to follow along, or using a well-timed pause to create suspense around what’s coming next.
Speak faster or slower. When you change speeds, people take note: What’s different here? Why does this part sound distinct? And that means they’ll tune in to what you’re saying.
Use a story or analogy. A real-world example can help people understand and relate to your topic, especially if it’s a technical one.
